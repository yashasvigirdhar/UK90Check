## Overview

This tool helps you track your days spent outside the UK in preparation for your UK citizenship application. According to UK citizenship rules, you cannot be outside the UK for more than 90 days in the 12 months preceding your citizenship application. The 12-month period can begin after you receive your Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR).

## Input Requirements

### Travel Dates

- Include both past and future travel plans
- Only start and end dates are required - no additional details needed

## Output Information

1. Days outside the UK from start date until today
2. Days outside the UK in the full 12-month period (including planned future absences)
